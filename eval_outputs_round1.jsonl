In terms of the liver tests, they are not specific for hepatitis B or C. They are designed to provide an overall picture of liver health and function, and elevated liver enzymes can indicate inflammation or damage to the liver, which can be caused by a variety of factors, including hepatitis B or C.

  "reference": "As your pregnancy test result is negative, it is unlikely that you are pregnant. The spotting you experienced on the 24th could be related to ovulation or implantation bleeding, but it is difficult to say for sure without further evaluation.  Regarding the leg cramps, abdominal pain, and light period, these symptoms can have many possible causes, including hormonal imbalances, stress, or other health conditions. It is best to discuss these symptoms with your doctor to determine the underlying cause and appropriate treatment. As for Deviry (medroxyprogesterone), it is commonly used to regulate menstrual cycles and can also be used to induce menstruation if necessary. It is important to inform your doctor if you are trying to conceive, as this medication can affect fertility and pregnancy. In general, Deviry is not recommended during pregnancy, as it can increase the risk of birth defects and other complications. Therefore, it is best to discuss your options with your doctor and follow their recommendations based on your individual circumstances."

Hookworms are parasitic nematodes that can infect humans and cause a range of symptoms, including anemia, abdominal pain, and diarrhea. The eggs of the parasite can be shed in the stool and can be identified by examining a stool sample under a microscope. In addition to the O&P test, a blood test may also be used to detect antibodies to the parasite. Treatment for hookworm infection typically involves the use of antiparasitic medications, such as albendazole or mebendazole, along with measures to address any nutritional deficiencies caused by the infection."
