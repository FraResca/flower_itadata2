Together, these proteins mediate the attachment and entry of the virus into host cells.  When HIV encounters a CD4+ T cell, gp120 binds to the CD4 receptor on the surface of the cell and then to a co-receptor, such as CCR5 or CXCR4. This triggers a conformational change in gp41, which exposes a hydrophobic region that can insert into the target cell membrane. This allows the fusion of the viral and cellular membranes, and the release of the viral core into the host cell cytoplasm.  gp120 is an attractive target for antiretroviral therapy, as drugs that inhibit the binding of gp120 to CD4+ T cells can prevent the attachment of the virus to host cells and block the replication of the virus."

In terms of the liver tests, they are not specific for hepatitis B or C. They are designed to provide an overall picture of liver health and function, and elevated liver enzymes can indicate inflammation or damage to the liver, which can be caused by a variety of factors, including hepatitis B or C. Therefore, if your liver tests were normal, it is a good sign, but it does not rule out the possibility of hepatitis B or C entirely. If you are still concerned about hepatitis B, you can speak with your healthcare provider about getting re-tested to confirm that you are negative.
