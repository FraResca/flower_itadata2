The bloating, loose stools, burning sensation in the abdomen, and intolerance to certain foods are typical symptoms of functional dyspepsia. The hand and feet pains, headaches, and breathlessness may be related to anxiety or IBS. The medication you are taking, Rabeprazole, is a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) that reduces stomach acid production and can improve symptoms of functional dyspepsia. However, long-term use of PPIs can cause side effects such as magnesium deficiency, bone loss, and an increased risk of infections. For your symptoms, I would recommend a combination of lifestyle changes and medication. Lifestyle changes include avoiding trigger foods and eating smaller, more frequent meals, avoiding alcohol and smoking, reducing stress, and getting regular physical activity. Medications that can help with IBS symptoms include antispasmodics, fiber supplements, and antidepressants. I would also recommend discussing the possibility of tapering off the PPI with your doctor and monitoring your magnesium levels. If your symptoms persist or worsen, you may benefit from further testing or referral to a gastroenterologist.

With treatment and time, the vegetation shrinks and can become fibrosed or calcified. It may not disappear completely. Large vegetations occur with fungal endocarditis or Staphylococcus aureus endocarditis. The hemodynamic effects are mostly due to valvular regurgitation as a result of valve destruction. The valve and the surrounding anatomy should be carefully inspected for the following complications: Fistula Perforation Prosthetic dehiscence Aneurysm Vegetations Valve ulcers or erosions Rupture of chordaes Endocardial jet lesions Flail leaflets or cusps Abscess formation (annular and ring) In general, transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) is often adequate for the diagnosis of infective endocarditis in cases where cardiac structures-of-interest are well visualized. The transthoracic echocardiogram has a sensitivity and specificity of approximately 65% and 95% if the echocardiographer believes there is'probable' or'almost certain' evidence of endocarditis.   Specific situations where transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is preferred over TTE include: The presence of a prosthetic valve Poor transthoracic views Continuing sepsis despite adequate antibiotic therapy New PR prolongation No signs of endocarditis on transthoracic echocardiography, but high clinical suspicion Suspected periannular complications Children with complex congenital cardiac lesions Patients with S.

  "reference": "The T638 phosphorylation site is not required for the catalytic function of PKCalpha per se, but serves to control the duration of activation by regulating the rate of dephosphorylation and inactivation of the protein. This is achieved through the cooperative interaction between the T638 and T497 sites; if either of these residues is not phosphorylated, the protein is supersensitive to phosphatase action. This model of PKCalpha function is likely to be of general significance to the protein kinase superfamily, where similarly juxtaposed sites exist. We conclude that dephosphorylation of PKCalpha, and, by inference, other protein kinases, is regulated by multisite phosphorylation."

Sometimes two or more types of treatment may be used at the same time or used one after the other. Before treatment starts, ask your health care team about possible side effects and how treatment may change your normal activities. Because cancer treatments often damage healthy cells and tissues, side effects are common. Side effect may not be the same for each person, and they may change from one treatment session to the next. Surgery: Surgery is the main treatment for both colon cancer and rectal cancer. The types of surgery are different for each cancer. For colon cancer, surgery type includes colectomy, segmental resection and laparoscopic-assisted colectomy. As rectal cancer is concerned, there are low anterior resection, proctectomy with colo-anal anastomosis, abdominoperineal (AP) resection and pelvic exenteration. Radiation therapy: It includes external-beam radiation therapy and brachytherapy (internal radiation therapy). This is a cancer treatment to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing by using high-energy x-rays or other types of radiation. Chemotherapy: This treatment is to use drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Targeted therapy: This type of therapy is to use drugs such as monoclonal antibodies to attack parts of cancer cells."

  "prompt": "Could you explain \"radiation-induced pericarditis\" in proper English?",
  "prediction": "Radiation-induced pericarditis is a condition in which radiation exposure causes a local increase in pericardial effusion and pericardial thickening.",
  "reference": "The survival rate in Hodgkin lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and breast carcinomas has significantly improved with use of radiation therapy.However, radiation therapy to thoracic and mediastinal cancers have also led to the development of pericarditis, coronary artery disease, cardiomyopathy, conduction abnormalities in heart and valvular heart diseases which account for significant morbidity and mortality. Radiation-induced pericarditis was first described in the mid-1960s. The radiation-induced pericardial disease may be classified as acute pericarditis, delayed pericarditis, pancarditis, constrictive pericarditis, and pericardial effusion. Radiation therapy leads to disruption of endothelium and subsequent episodes of ischemia. The resulting fibrosis and fibrinous exudates replace collagen fibers. Radiation-induced pericardial disease can occur in any cancer survivor who receive thoracic radiation therapy, including breast cancer, Hodgkin's lymphoma, esophageal cancer, and lung cancer. Radiation-induced pericarditis depends on the total dose of radiation, the dose per fraction, the amount of cardiac silhouette exposed, and the nature of the radiation source. The incidence is higher with doses greater than 40 Gy (4000 rad). Echocardiography is the most commonly used screening modality for the detection and follow-up of radiation-induced cardiac disease. Acute pericarditis usually develops a few weeks after radiation exposure. Nearly 20% of patients with acute pericarditis develop chronic or constrictive pericarditis in the next 5-10 years following radiation therapy. The risk is increased when pericardial effusion was present previously. Chronic pericarditis can also occur in patients without a history of acute pericarditis. Acute pericarditis is a rare complication of radiation therapy. It presents with nonspecific pericarditis symptoms such as chest pain and fever shortly after radiation therapy. Delayed pericarditis occurs from months to years after exposure to radiation. It usually presents with chest pain, dyspnea, and orthopnea. The physical examination may show fever and pericardial rub. Laboratory findings include elevated inflammatory markers such as neutrophil count and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). On ECG, non-specific ST and T wave changes or ST-segment elevation in all leads may be noted. The majority of acute pericarditis cases are self-limited and respond well to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and colchicine. In acute or chronic pericarditis, protein-rich exudate may accumulate in the pericardial sac leading to pericardial effusion. Findings on a chest x-ray or chest CT suggestive of chronic pericarditis include pericardial effusion and pericardial thickening. If the effusion is large enough, it may lead to tamponade. In patients presenting with tamponade, the physical examination may show hypotension, tachycardia, and jugular venous distention with a prominent Y descent, Kussmaul\u2019s sign, and distant heart sound. Radiation-induced pericardial effusion can be confused with malignant pericarditis and hypothyroidism -induced pericarditis. Pericarditis with large effusion can be drained either percutaneously or surgically. Those with recurrent pericardial effusion can be treated with pericardiotomy(pericardial window) or by surgical stripping. Constrictive pericarditis is a late complication of radiation therapy. Patients typically present with signs and symptoms of heart failure, similar to other causes of constrictive pericarditis. Cardiac MRI may be helpful in the diagnosis of constrictive pericarditis. It is useful to confirm the pericardial thickening. Cardiac catheterization may be also helpful in the diagnosis of constrictive pericarditis associated with radiation therapy. Pericardiectomy is recommended for patients who develop constrictive pericarditis. However, the perioperative mortality rate is higher in radiation-induced constrictive pericarditis compared to that of idiopathic constrictive pericarditis. Effective measures for the primary prevention of radiation-induced pericarditis include reducing the dose and volume of cardiac irradiation when possible."

  "prompt": "What is the second line management for recurrent variable decelerations during labor?",
  "prediction": "The second line management for recurrent variable decelerations during labor is to have the patient continue to deliver the baby.",
  "reference": "Variable decelerations during labor are a common occurrence and can be caused by a variety of factors, including fetal distress, umbilical cord compression, or maternal hypotension. The management of variable decelerations depends on the severity and frequency of the decelerations, as well as the overall health of the mother and baby. The second line management for recurrent variable decelerations is transcervical amnioinfusion, a procedure in which fluid is infused into the uterus through the cervix to help cushion the baby and relieve pressure on the umbilical cord. This can help improve blood flow and oxygen delivery to the baby, reducing the risk of fetal distress and the need for more invasive interventions such as a cesarean section. Other management options for variable decelerations may include changing the mother's position, administering oxygen to the mother, or using medications to stimulate contractions or relax the uterus."
