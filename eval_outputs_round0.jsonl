  "reference": "The survival rate in Hodgkin lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and breast carcinomas has significantly improved with use of radiation therapy.However, radiation therapy to thoracic and mediastinal cancers have also led to the development of pericarditis, coronary artery disease, cardiomyopathy, conduction abnormalities in heart and valvular heart diseases which account for significant morbidity and mortality. Radiation-induced pericarditis was first described in the mid-1960s. The radiation-induced pericardial disease may be classified as acute pericarditis, delayed pericarditis, pancarditis, constrictive pericarditis, and pericardial effusion. Radiation therapy leads to disruption of endothelium and subsequent episodes of ischemia. The resulting fibrosis and fibrinous exudates replace collagen fibers. Radiation-induced pericardial disease can occur in any cancer survivor who receive thoracic radiation therapy, including breast cancer, Hodgkin's lymphoma, esophageal cancer, and lung cancer. Radiation-induced pericarditis depends on the total dose of radiation, the dose per fraction, the amount of cardiac silhouette exposed, and the nature of the radiation source. The incidence is higher with doses greater than 40 Gy (4000 rad). Echocardiography is the most commonly used screening modality for the detection and follow-up of radiation-induced cardiac disease. Acute pericarditis usually develops a few weeks after radiation exposure. Nearly 20% of patients with acute pericarditis develop chronic or constrictive pericarditis in the next 5-10 years following radiation therapy. The risk is increased when pericardial effusion was present previously. Chronic pericarditis can also occur in patients without a history of acute pericarditis. Acute pericarditis is a rare complication of radiation therapy. It presents with nonspecific pericarditis symptoms such as chest pain and fever shortly after radiation therapy. Delayed pericarditis occurs from months to years after exposure to radiation. It usually presents with chest pain, dyspnea, and orthopnea. The physical examination may show fever and pericardial rub. Laboratory findings include elevated inflammatory markers such as neutrophil count and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). On ECG, non-specific ST and T wave changes or ST-segment elevation in all leads may be noted. The majority of acute pericarditis cases are self-limited and respond well to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and colchicine. In acute or chronic pericarditis, protein-rich exudate may accumulate in the pericardial sac leading to pericardial effusion. Findings on a chest x-ray or chest CT suggestive of chronic pericarditis include pericardial effusion and pericardial thickening. If the effusion is large enough, it may lead to tamponade. In patients presenting with tamponade, the physical examination may show hypotension, tachycardia, and jugular venous distention with a prominent Y descent, Kussmaul\u2019s sign, and distant heart sound. Radiation-induced pericardial effusion can be confused with malignant pericarditis and hypothyroidism -induced pericarditis. Pericarditis with large effusion can be drained either percutaneously or surgically. Those with recurrent pericardial effusion can be treated with pericardiotomy(pericardial window) or by surgical stripping. Constrictive pericarditis is a late complication of radiation therapy. Patients typically present with signs and symptoms of heart failure, similar to other causes of constrictive pericarditis. Cardiac MRI may be helpful in the diagnosis of constrictive pericarditis. It is useful to confirm the pericardial thickening. Cardiac catheterization may be also helpful in the diagnosis of constrictive pericarditis associated with radiation therapy. Pericardiectomy is recommended for patients who develop constrictive pericarditis. However, the perioperative mortality rate is higher in radiation-induced constrictive pericarditis compared to that of idiopathic constrictive pericarditis. Effective measures for the primary prevention of radiation-induced pericarditis include reducing the dose and volume of cardiac irradiation when possible."

G6PD deficiency is a genetic disorder that affects the activity of an enzyme called glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, which is important for protecting red blood cells from oxidative damage. When individuals with G6PD deficiency are exposed to certain drugs or other substances that cause oxidative stress, such as nitrofurantoin, it can trigger hemolysis. Therefore, it is important for healthcare providers to screen patients for G6PD deficiency before prescribing nitrofurantoin or other medications that may pose a risk for hemolysis."

Roseola typically affects children between the ages of 6 months and 2 years and is characterized by a sudden onset of high fever, which usually lasts for 3-5 days, followed by the appearance of a pinkish-red, blanching maculopapular rash on the trunk, neck, and limbs. Other symptoms of roseola may include irritability, swollen lymph nodes, and mild respiratory symptoms. Roseola is usually a self-limited illness that resolves on its own within a week or two, and treatment is generally supportive, such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen for fever and hydration for fluid loss. It is important to seek medical attention if a child exhibits symptoms of roseola, as some other conditions, such as measles or rubella, can cause similar symptoms and require different treatment."

  "reference": "The C3 convertase produced by the alternative complement pathway is called C3bBb.  The complement system is a part of the immune system that helps to identify and eliminate pathogens such as bacteria and viruses. The complement system can be activated through three different pathways: the classical pathway, the lectin pathway, and the alternative pathway. The alternative pathway is activated by the presence of certain molecules on the surface of pathogens or damaged cells. It leads to the formation of a C3 convertase, which cleaves C3 into C3a and C3b. The C3b fragment then combines with factor B to form C3bB, which is stabilized by factor D to form the C3bBb complex. C3bBb is the name of the C3 convertase produced by the alternative complement pathway. It is composed of C3b and factor Bb components and is responsible for the amplification of the complement cascade by producing more C3b fragments, which can then bind to the surface of pathogens and stimulate the formation of the membrane attack complex (MAC)."
